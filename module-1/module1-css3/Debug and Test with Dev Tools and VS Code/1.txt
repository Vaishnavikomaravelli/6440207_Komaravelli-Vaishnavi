Step 1: Use Chrome DevTools Device Toolbar
Open your webpage in Google Chrome.
Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect or press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac) to open DevTools.
Click the Toggle device toolbar button (phone/tablet icon) in the top-left corner of DevTools or press Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + M (Mac).
At the top of the page, you’ll see a responsive viewport where you can:
Select preset devices like iPhone, iPad, Pixel, etc.
Manually resize the viewport by dragging edges or entering width/height.
Rotate the viewport between portrait and landscape.
Observe how your layout responds to different screen sizes and orientations.

Step 2: Inspect and Edit Styles Live
While in DevTools, select the Elements tab.
Hover over HTML elements in the Elements panel or click them on the page preview to inspect.
On the right side, under Styles, you’ll see all CSS rules applied to that element.
You can:
Toggle individual CSS properties on/off by checking/unchecking.
Edit values live by clicking them (e.g., change font-size: 18px to 14px) and seeing immediate effects.
Add new CSS properties temporarily to test fixes.
This lets you quickly debug layout issues like navigation links not stacking or images not resizing properly.

Step 3: Check Network Tab for External CSS Loading
Open the Network tab in DevTools.
Reload the page (F5 or Ctrl + R).
Look for your external CSS file(s) in the list (usually ending with .css).
Check the Status column to ensure it’s 200 (OK).
If the CSS file is missing or shows 404, it means the stylesheet is not loading correctly — double-check the link tag in your HTML.
